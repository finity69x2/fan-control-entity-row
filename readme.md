# Fan Control Entity Row

## This is an element to add a fan control row to Home Assistant.

It uses the code that can be found in my fan control package @ https://github.com/finity69x2/Home-Assistant/blob/master/packages/fan_package.yaml

Installation:

The easiest way to install this is to use the Home Assistant Community Store (HACS) in Home Assistant.

Follow the instructions there for installation making sure you note the "url:" section for the resources addition.

Conversely, if you don't use HACS you can install it manually by performing the following:

Copy the fan-control-entity-row.js file to the appropriate folder in your Home Assistant Configuration directory (/config/www/).

Place the following in your "resources" section in your lovelace configuration (updating the localation to where you placed the above file):

  ```yaml
    - url: /local/fan-control-entity-row.js
      type: module
  ```
    
Then to use this in a card place the following in your entity card:


<b>Options:</b>

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| entity | String | Yes | none | a fan entity_id |
| type | String | Yes | none | custom:fan-control-entity-row |
| name | String | No | none | A custom name for the entity in the row |
| customTheme | Boolean | No | false | set to true to use a custom theme |
| sendStateWithSpeed | Boolean | No | false | Used only for certain firmware that requires the State command be sent with the Speed command  |
| sendSpeedWithOff | Boolean | No | true | Used only for certain firmware that requires the off command be sent without the Speed command  |
| isOffColor | String | No | '#f44c09' | Sets the color of the 'Off' button if fan is off |
| isOnLowColor | String | No | '#43A047' | Sets the color of the 'Low' button if fan is on low |
| isOnMedColor | String | No | '#43A047' | Sets the color of the 'Med' button if fan is on Medium |
| isOnHiColor | String | No | '#43A047' | Sets the color of the 'Hi' button if fan is on high |

| buttonInactiveColor | String | No | '#759aaa' | Sets the color of the the buttons if that selection is off |
| customOffText | String | No | 'OFF' | Sets the text of the "off" button |
| customLowText | String | No | 'LOW' | Sets the text of the "low" speed button |
| customMedText | String | No | 'MED' | Sets the text of the "medium" speed button |
| customHiText | String | No | 'HIGH' | Sets the text of the "High" speed button |


The values for the colors can be any valid color string in "HEX", "RGB" or by color name.

*NOTE: The speeds that your fan uses in Home Assistant need to use all lowercase letters. The only time this should be a concern is if you are using a template fan. Be sure to make your speeds all lowercase in the fan configuration.

The optional "sendStateWithSpeed" config entry is only needed to be set to true if for some reason your fan needs the state command of "on" to be sent along with the desired speed command. As far as I know this is only needed for use with fans flashed with the ESPHome Firmware.
